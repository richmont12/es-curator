# Developing the backend

## Some guidance

* Backend is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Start VS Code on this directory
* working with go modules
    * all decoupling happens on package level, not module level for this backend implementation
