# Developing the backend

## Some guidance

* Backend is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * VS Code extensions used:
        * go
        * go plugin dlv
* Start VS Code on this directory    
* working with go modules
    * all decoupling happens on package level, not module level for this backend implementation
